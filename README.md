# HackNuTeamBitLords

Team Bit Lords's solution to Google's case for tracking GPS location in 3D.

Our solution uses phones' built-in barometer data to understand user's elevation above sea level and relative to the ground.
To display user location points above ground on the website, we used treebox.js.
The mobile application uses AR and needs SceenKit and Mapkit libraries to work.
